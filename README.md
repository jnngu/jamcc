# jamcc
A Compiler written for a small subset of C written in Rust.
Written following [this tutorial.](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html)


## Why?
I was inspired by my team's work on a [custom-kinda-brainfuck compiler for a hackathon.](https://github.com/brandonspark/Runtime) 

## Why Rust?
I wanted to write it in SML but I was dissuaded by some friends. Maybe in the future.
