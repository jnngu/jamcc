# jamcc
A Compiler written for a small subset of C written in Rust.

## Why?
I was inspired by my team's work on a [custom-kinda-brainfuck compiler for a hackathon.](https://github.com/brandonspark/Runtime) 

## Why Rust?
I wanted to write it in SML but I was dissuaded by some friends. Maybe in the future.

## What can it do?
Nothing as of yet. I'm still writing the syntax tree generator and the tree parser. Will update this as the project progresses.
